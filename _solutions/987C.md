================

It is the middle of 2018 and Maria Stepanovna, who lives outside Krasnokamensk (a town in Zabaikalsky region), wants to rent three displays to highlight an important problem.

There are n displays placed along a road, and the i-th of them can display a text with font size si only. Maria Stepanovna wants to rent such three displays with indices i < j < k that the font size increases if you move along the road in a particular direction. Namely, the condition s~i~ < s~j~ < s~k~ should be held.

The rent cost is for the i-th display is ci. Please determine the smallest cost Maria Stepanovna should pay.

*1. Think by choosing which element you will end up in minimum operations of finding the rest two.*

Solution
--------
Itâ€™s clear from the problem that the given array C or S cannot be sorted, as it can change the order of elements. Additionally, S~i~ < S~j~ < S~k~ is a constraint.

We now have to figure how to choose 3 elements such that its cost is minimum and S~i~ < S~j~ < S~k~.

Since S~i~, S~j~, S~k~ need not to be consecutive, there are lot of possibilities to pick 3 strictly increasing elements, which we can do by a very naive brute force solution. But this will be an inefficient approach considering the time limit.

But the same can be done in a time complexity O(n^2^) by thinking a bit different.

The basic idea is to pick an element S~j~. S~j~ - because it makes our job easier. *Why?* Consider we are taking S~i~ then there are lot of possibilities of finding S~j~ and S~k~. Instead if we take S~j~ then we know that there is just one element on its right and left. So after picking S~j~, find an element S~i~ toward its left such that S~i~ < S~j~ and its cost C~i~ is the minimum of all costs in the left part. Similarly we have to find S~k~ such that S~k~ > S~j~ and its cost C~k~ is the minimum of all costs in the right part.

Store sum of such C~i~, C~j~, C~k~ and find minimum among all which is the answer.
